        Kismet Log Files Parser

README:
The script will read all csv files in directory, parse them and 
make HTML output. This piece of software IS VERY bugyy so use it just
for your own needs. 

If you find any bug please contact me by mail (macoblava.net) and I will
try to debug the code ASAP. If you think of any other feature which is not already implemented, 
drop me and I'll try to add the feature ASAP.

INSTALLATION:
- point $dir var to the .csv Kismet log file
- directory HAS TO BE READABLE AND EXECUTABLE for http server +
        the same for the files - it is recomended to copy log files to 'data' directory
        under kismet2html directory
- done, run from web browser

- you can rewrite $dir variable in URL by setting $ddir variable such as:
